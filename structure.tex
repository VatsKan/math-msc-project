Explain $\bigtriangledown = d +A$

\subsection{Examples}

Directional derivative.

Show $\bigtriangledown^1 - \bigtriangledown^2$ is tensorial (i.e. comes from bundle homo even though $\bigtriangledown^1,  \bigtriangledown^2$ is not neccessarily). (See exposition notes). (See Salamon notes for why relevant).

Standard trivial connection on trival bundle. (For line bundle, and more generally for $MxR^k$). Various perspectives on this (i.e. using the two defs). Also obtain d+A formula in this setting (i.e. $\bigtriangledown = \omega + d$ (see exposition notes), also noting that diff of connections is tensorial from previous example).

Aside: show how $d^\bigtriangledown$ relates to the usual exterior derivative $d$.

Define flat connection (i.e. when curvature vanishes).

Define cohomology for when have a flat connection.

TODO: Understand correspondance $\rho^\bigtriangledown -> \bigtriangledown$ in salamon pg 235. (Looks like some kind of Rep theory I think).
